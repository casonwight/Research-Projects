# Simulation Study from Aralis and Brookmeyer #
# Replicated by Dr. Warr and Cason Wight      #
###############################################

# Note that Aralis and Brrokmeyer replicate with 100 different data sets
# They also performed this same analysis with mean observation time 
#     intervals of 100 as well as our 50


# Other notes from Aralis and Brookmeyer:
#         Convergence:
#                Mean # of iterations was 28 (range of 11 to 52)
#                Mean total runtime was 15.6 hours for those with 20 to 34 iterations
#                m_1=1, and the number of observations increases by 1 with each iteration
#                They say that the initial parameters do not seem to affect their results
#         Stopping requirement: 
#                delta1 = 0.001; delta2 = .05
#                max(abs(new_pars-old_pars)/(abs(old_pars)+delta1)) < delta2 
#                Must hold for three straight iterations
#         Additional Packages:
#                They use Rcpp for the expectation step
#                They use constrOptim for the maximization step
